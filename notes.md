pwd: Stands for "Print Working Directory." It displays the current directory's full path on the command line.

cd: Stands for "Change Directory." It's used to navigate between directories. You can use it to move into different directories or go back to the parent directory.

ls: Lists the contents of the current directory, including files and subdirectories. You can provide options to customize the listing, such as ls -l for a long format or ls -a to show hidden files.

vim A text editor for the command line. It's known for its powerful features and modes. You can create and edit text files with Vim.

nano Another command-line text editor, but it's simpler and more user-friendly compared to Vim. It's a good choice for beginners.

mkdir Stands for "Make Directory." It's used to create new directories or folders in the file system.

mv Stands for "Move." It's used to move or rename files and directories. You can also use it for both operations at once.

rm Stands for "Remove." It's used to delete files or directories. Be cautious when using this command, as it doesn't move items to a trash/recycle bin but deletes them permanently.

man Short for "manual," it's used to access the system's manual pages. You can look up documentation and information about various commands by typing man followed by the command name, e.g., man ls.

ssh Stands for "Secure Shell." It's a protocol and command used for securely connecting to remote servers or devices over a network.

ps Stands for "Process Status." It's used to list currently running processes in the terminal. You can see information about running programs and their process IDs.
