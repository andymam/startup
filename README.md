## Idea: Weather App

### Elevator Pitch
My startup idea will be a weather app that allows a user to login and check the weather in either their current location, or any location they choose to input. 

### Key Features
This app will have features such as degrees, current weather conditions, and an about page.

I will be using certain technologies such as:

- **Authentication**: by having the user log in, using their name
- **Database data**: my application will display weather data that will come from a database
- **WebSocket data**: real time weather will be shown, so it will update with time, and provide current conditions

### Design

## HTML deliverable

For this deliverable I built out the structure of my application using HTML.

- **HTML pages** - Two HTML pages, with the main one being the weather page that shows the conditions, and the other being a login page
- **Links** - Provide a link on the main page that directs the user to the login page
- **Text** - included text as placeholders for some of the functions like displaying degrees and city
- **Images** - included an example svg of a weather image
- **Login** - included a login page with an input section and sign in button
- **Database** - The user can auto-locate their location's weather
- **WebSocket** - The user can input a certain city to see the weather there
